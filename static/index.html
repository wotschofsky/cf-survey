    <h1>Felix's Telekom Routing Experiment</h1>

    <p>Hello there! I'm <a href="https://wotschofsky.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Felix
        Wotschofsky</a>, and welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>

    <p>This site is more than just a webpage – it's an experiment born out of curiosity and concern. I've been noticing
      something peculiar about how Deutsche Telekom, Germany's largest ISP,
      handles our data when accessing websites using Cloudflare's free plan.</p>

    <p>Here's the thing: I believe these companies are routing requests from us, their German customers, all the way to
      servers in the United States when accessing millions of websites on Cloudflare's free plan. Now, you might be
      wondering,
      "So what?" Well, it's not just about the unnecessary detour our data is taking – it's about the bigger picture.
    </p>

    <p>This practice isn't just inefficient; it's potentially harmful in two significant ways:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>It directly impacts millions of customers, compromising the speed and efficiency of our internet services when
        accessing the vast number of web properties using Cloudflare's free plan.</li>
      <li>It has an environmental impact. All those long-distance data transfers consume more energy than necessary,
        contributing to a larger carbon footprint.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>While website owners could resolve this by upgrading to a paid plan, this doesn't address the core issue
      affecting
      millions of users accessing the countless websites that rely on the free tier. Through this experiment, I'm hoping
      to
      shed light on this issue and perhaps spark a conversation about more efficient, environmentally friendly practices
      in
      our digital infrastructure.</p>

      <h3>Your Anonymous Contribution</h3>
      <p>By visiting this page, you're already contributing to the experiment! Don't worry, it's completely anonymous.
        Here's what happens:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The page records which Internet Service Provider (ISP) you're using.</li>
        <li>It also notes which Cloudflare Point of Presence (PoP) served this page to you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information helps me understand the routing patterns and efficiency of different ISPs. Your privacy is
        respected – no personal data is collected or stored.</p>

    <p>Thank you for stopping by and taking an interest in this project. Your curiosity and awareness are the first
      steps toward positive change. If you'd like to discuss this further or have any insights to share, please don't
      hesitate to reach out to me.</p>
